# roboPACE
Python implementation of automated massively parallel PACE on a Hamilton STARlet using the [pyhamilton](https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton) package

The repo mostly only exists to show how pyhamilton can be integrated with other Python packages. With pyhamilton, you can interface smoothly with hardware and software that is custom-built or not supported by Hamilton.

Recognizing: it would take a lot of work to make this run without modification on a system other than that on which it was developed. Modularity and platform independence coming soon!

Have a look at the source, and maybe try:
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> py 180703_24_personal_turbs\180703_24_personal_turbs.py
```
